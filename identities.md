Managing built-in Azure roles involves understanding the predefined roles provided by Azure and how to assign them to users, groups, or service principals. Here are the main points:

### 1. **Understanding Built-in Roles**
   - **Owner**: Full access to all resources, including the ability to delegate access to others.
   - **Contributor**: Can create and manage all types of Azure resources but cannot grant access to others.
   - **Reader**: Can view existing Azure resources but cannot make any changes.
   - **User Access Administrator**: Can manage user access to Azure resources.

### 2. **Assigning Roles**
   - **Azure Portal**: 
     - Navigate to the resource, resource group, or subscription.
     - Go to **Access control (IAM)**.
     - Click **Add role assignment**.
     - Select the role and assign it to a user, group, or service principal.
   - **Azure CLI**:
     ```powershell
     az role assignment create --assignee <userPrincipalName> --role <roleName> --scope <scope>
     ```
   - **Azure PowerShell**:
     ```powershell
     New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId <userObjectId> -RoleDefinitionName <roleName> -Scope <scope>
     ```

### 3. **Managing Role Assignments**
   - **View Role Assignments**: 
     - In the Azure portal, navigate to **Access control (IAM)** and select the **Role assignments** tab.
     - Use `Get-AzRoleAssignment` in PowerShell or `az role assignment list` in Azure CLI.
   - **Remove Role Assignments**:
     - In the Azure portal, navigate to **Access control (IAM)**, find the role assignment, and click **Remove**.
     - Use `Remove-AzRoleAssignment` in PowerShell or `az role assignment delete` in Azure CLI.

### 4. **Best Practices**
   - **Least Privilege Principle**: Assign the minimum permissions necessary for users to perform their tasks.
   - **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review role assignments to ensure they are still appropriate.
   - **Use Custom Roles**: If built-in roles do not meet your needs, create custom roles with specific permissions.

These steps should help you effectively manage built-in Azure roles⁴⁵. If you need more detailed information on any specific area, feel free to ask!
